i have no idea who would benefit from this but i had spent a ridicilous amount of time to reverse-engineer this game to understand the mechanics
and eventually created a save file editor (.ipynb) 

the principle is the local storage has base64 encoded SO(sharedObject) in AMF format. 
if you point your browser to: https://www.minigames.pro/swords-and-sandals-2-emperors-reign-full-version/#
and check the local storage of your browser you will find the base64 string that represents the save file. 
you may have to create a character and then kill the first prisioner to get a proper save file.

i have included amf spec and some of my work including a kaitai struct parser (.ksy)
